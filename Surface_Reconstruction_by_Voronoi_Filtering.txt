In
tro
duction
The
problem
of
reconstructing
a
surface
from
scattered
sample
p
oin
ts
arises
in
man
y
ap-
plications
suc
h
as
computer
graphics,
medical
imaging,
and
cartograph
y
.
In
this
pap
er
w
e
consider
the
sp
ecic
reconstruction
problem
in
whic
h
the
input
is
a
set
of
sample
p
oin
ts
S
dra
wn
from
a
smo
oth
t
w
o-dimensional
manifold
F
em
b
edded
in
three
dimensions,
and
the
desired
output
is
a
triangular
mesh
with
v
ertex
set
equal
to
S
that
faithfully
represen
ts
F
.
W
e
giv
e
a
\pro
v
ably
correct"
com
binatorial
algorithm
for
this
problem.
That
is,
w
e
giv
e
a
condition
on
the
input
sample
p
oin
ts,
suc
h
that
if
the
condition
is
met
the
algorithm
giv
es
guaran
teed
results:
a
triangular
mesh
of
the
same
top
ology
as
the
surface
F
,
with
p
osition
and
surface
normals
within
a
small
error
tolerance.
The
algorithm
relies
on
the
w
ell-kno
wn
constructions
of
the
Delauna
y
triangulation
and
the
V
oronoi
diagram.
This
pap
er
is
an
extension
of
previous
w
ork
b
y
Amen
ta,
Bern,
and
Eppstein
[
]
on
reconstructing
curv
es
in
t
w
o
dimensions.
Our
previous
w
ork
dened
a
planar
graph
on
the
sample
p
oin
ts
called
the
\crust".
The
crust
is
the
set
of
edges
in
the
Delauna
y
triangulation
of
the
sample
p
oin
ts
that
can
b
e
enclosed
b
y
circles
empt
y
not
only
of
sample
p
oin
ts,
but
also
of
V
oronoi
v
ertices.
The
crust
comes
with
a
guaran
tee:
if
the
curv
e
is
\w
ell-sampled",
then
the
crust
con
tains
exactly
the
edges
b
et
w
een
sample
p
oin
ts
adjacen
t
on
the
curv
e.
Our
notion
of
w
ell-sampled,
whic
h
in
v
olv
es
the
medial
axis
of
the
curv
e,
is
sensitiv
e
to
the
lo
cal
geometry
.
Hence
our
algorithm,
unlik
e
other
algorithms
for
this
problem,
allo
ws
highly
non
uniform
sampling,
dense
in
detailed
areas
y
et
sparse
in
featureless
areas.

Previous
w
ork
on
the
reconstruction
problem
falls
in
to
t
w
o
camps:
computer
graphics
and
computational
geometry
.
The
algorithms
in
use
in
computer
graphics
t
ypically
compute
an
appro
ximating
surface,
that
is,
a
surface
passing
close
b
y
,
rather
than
exactly
through,
the
original
sample
p
oin
ts.
The
algorithms
devised
b
y
computational
geometers
t
ypically
restrict
atten
tion
to
surfaces
on
the
original
sample
p
oin
ts,
usually
a
carefully
c
hosen
subset
of
the
Delauna
y
triangulation.
Only
recen
tly
ha
v
e
computational
geometers
started
pub-
lishing
algorithms
with
pro
v
able
prop
erties,
and
un
til
this
curren
t
pap
er
these
algorithms
with
guaran
tees
applied
only
to
reconstructing
curv
es
in
t
w
o
dimensions.
The
rst
and
most
widely
kno
wn
reconstruction
algorithm
in
the
computer
graphics
comm
unit
y
is
the
w
ork
of
Hopp
e
et
al.
[	
,
0
,

].
This
algorithm
estimates
a
tangen
t
plane
at
eac
h
sample
using
the
k
nearest
neigh
b
ors,
and
uses
the
distance
to
the
plane
of
the
closest
sample
p
oin
t
as
a
signed
distance
function.
The
zero
set
of
this
function
is
then
con
toured
b
y
a
con
tin
uous
piecewise-linear
surface
using
the
marc
hing
cub
es
algorithm.
A
later
algorithm
b
y
Curless
and
Lev
o
y
[
]
is
designed
for
data
samples
collected
b
y
a
laser
range
scanner.
This
algorithm
sums
anisotropically
w
eigh
ted
con
tributions
from
the
samples
to
compute
a
signed
distance
function,
whic
h
is
then
discretized
on
v
o
xels
to
eliminate
the
marc
hing
cub
es
step.
These
t
w
o
computer
graphics
algorithms
are
quite
successful
in
practice,
but
ha
v
e
no
pro
v
able
guaran
tees.
Indeed
there
exist
arbitrarily
dense
sets
of
samples,
for
example
ones
with
almost
collinear
nearest
neigh
b
or
sets,
for
whic
h
the
algorithm
of
Hopp
e
et
al.
w
ould
fail.
The
most
famous
computational
geometry
construction
for
asso
ciating
a
p
olyhedral
shap
e
with
an
unorganized
set
of
p
oin
ts
is
the
-shap
e
of
Edelsbrunner
et
al.
[
,

].
Lik
e
our
reconstructed
surface,
the
-shap
e
is
a
sub
complex
of
the
Delauna
y
triangulation.
A
Delauna

simplex
(edge,
face,
etc.)
b
elongs
to
the
-shap
e
of
S
if
its
circumsphere
has
radius
at
most
.
The
ma
jor
dra
wbac
k
of
using
-shap
es
for
surface
reconstruction
is
that
the
optimal

of

An
early
algorithm
due
to
Boissonnat
[	
]
is
related
to
ours.
He
prop
osed
a
\sculpting"
heuristic
for
selecting
a
subset
of
Delauna
y
tetrahedra
to
represen
t
the
in
terior
of
an
ob
ject.
The
heuristic
is
motiv
ated
b
y
the
observ
ation
that
\t
ypical"
Delauna
y
tetrahedra
ha
v
e
circumspheres
appro
ximating
maximal
empt
y
balls
cen
tered
at
p
oin
ts
of
the
medial
axis;
our
algorithm
relies
on
this
same
observ
ation.
Boissonnat's
algorithm,
ho
w
ev
er,
o
v
erlo
oks
the
fact
that
ev
en
dense
sample
sets
can
giv
e
Delauna
y
tetrahedra
with
circumspheres
that
are
arbitrarily
far
from
the
medial
axis;
indeed
it
is
this
second
observ
ation
whic
h
motiv
ates
our
denition
of
p

Goldak,
Y

Knigh

and
Dong
[

made
a
similar
o

asserting
incorrectly
that

v
ertices
asymptotically
approac
h
the
medial

as
the

densit
y
go

.
Finally
,
for
the
t
w

problem
there
are
a
few
recen
t
algorithms
with
pro

guaran

e
that

Conclusions
and
F
uture
W
ork
In
this
pap
er
w
e
ha
v
e
giv
en
an
algorithm
for
reconstructing
an
in
terp
olating
surface
from
sample
p
oin
ts
in
three
dimensions.
The
algorithm
is
simple
enough
to
analyze,
easy
enough
to
implemen
t,
and
practical
enough
for
actual
use.
Our
previous
pap
er
[
]
ga
v

t
w
o
pro
v
ably
go
o
d
algorithms
for
reconstructing
curv
es
in
t
w
o
dimensions,
one
using
V
oronoi
ltering
as
in
this
pap
er,
and
the
other
using
the

-
sk
eleton.
It
is
in
teresting
to
ask
whether
the

-sk
eleton
can
b
e
generalized
to
the
problem
of
surface
reconstruction.
(W
e
kno
w
that
the
most
straigh
tforw
ard
generalization
of
the

-sk
eleton
do
es
not
w
ork.)
Another
in
teresting
question
concerns
the
generalization
of
V
oronoi
ltering
to
higher
dimensions.
Manifold
le
arning
is
the
problem
of
reconstructing
a
smo
oth
k
-dimensional
manifold
em
b
edded
in
I
R
d
.
This
problem
arises
in
mo
deling
unkno
wn
dynamical
systems
from

observ

[0
].
Ev
en
if
V
oronoi
ltering
can
b

generalized
to
this
problem,
its

the

case

whic

e
with
algorithms
that
compute
triangulations
only
in
k
-dimensional
subspaces
[0
],
rather
than
in
I
R
d
.
Along
with
the
t
w
o
theoretical
op
en
questions
outlined
ab
o
v
e,
there
are
sev
eral
quite
practical
directions
for
further
researc

on
our
algorithms.
What
is
the
empirical
maxim
um
v
alue
of
r
for
whic
h
our
algorithm

reliable
results?
W

e
that
the
v
alue
of
r

:0
in
Theorem

is
m
uc
h
smaller
than

.
Is
the
crust
useful
in
simplication
and
compression
of
p
olyhedra?
Can
the
crust
b
e
extended
to
inputs
with
creases
and

Can
