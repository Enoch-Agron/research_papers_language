Abstract
We study the conformal bootstrap for 3D CFTs with O(N) global symmetry. We
obtain rigorous upper bounds on the scaling dimensions of the ﬁrst O(N) singlet and
symmetric tensor operators appearing in the φi × φj OPE, where φi is a fundamental
of O(N). Comparing these bounds to previous determinations of critical exponents
in the O(N) vector models, we ﬁnd strong numerical evidence that the O(N) vector
models saturate the bootstrap constraints at all values of N. We also compute general
lower bounds on the central charge, giving numerical predictions for the values realized
in the O(N) vector models. We compare our predictions to previous computations in
the 1/N expansion, ﬁnding precise agreement at large values of N.

Introduction
Conformal ﬁeld theories (CFTs) oﬀer delightful examples of quantum ﬁeld theories that are
strongly coupled, yet contain enough symmetry and structure that they may turn out to
be tractable if the right techniques are found. Until recently, the idea of exploiting this
structure in order to ﬁnd complete non-perturbative solutions to theories was only carried
out successfully in 2D, most notably in the seminal work of [1]. However, over the last
several years great progress has been made at developing the conformal bootstrap [2, 3]
approach to CFTs in D > 2, where a large number of nontrivial bounds have been found
which follow very generally from the constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity [4–16].
The results obtained so far have been particularly striking in 3D, where it was found in [13]
that the CFT described by the critical 3D Ising model occupies a special place in the space
allowed by crossing symmetry and unitarity. Moreover it appears possible that a robust
numerical solution to this theory can be obtained using bootstrap techniques [17].
In this paper we will extend the work of [13] to study 3D CFTs with an O(N) global
symmetry using the conformal bootstrap. We will focus on theories containing a scalar ﬁeld
φi(x) in the vector representation of O(N). The most notable theories falling into this class
are the critical O(N) vector models [18, 19], which describe second-order phase transitions
in a variety of real-world systems at small values of N [20], and are also solvable in a 1/N
expansion at large values of N (see [21] for a review). Moreover, the O(N)-singlet sector
of this theory is thought to be holographically described by a higher-spin gauge theory in
AdS4 [22]. Previously, bootstrap ideas have been applied to the O(N) vector models in the
1/N expansion, for example in work by Lang and R¨uhl [23–28], Petkou [29, 30], and more
recently Maldacena and Zhiboedov [31, 32]. Our approach allows bootstrap constraints to
be studied (albeit numerically) at any value of N.
Our primary goal, following previous numerical studies of the bootstrap [4–16], will
be to place general upper bounds on the scaling dimensions of the ﬁrst nontrivial scalar
operators (both O(N) singlets S and O(N) symmetric tensors Tij) in the φi × φj operator
product expansion (OPE). We will also place general lower bounds on the central charge
c, deﬁned as the coeﬃcient appearing in the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor.
We will then compare these bounds to the best previous results based on Monte Carlo
simulations, analytical estimates, and the 1/N expansion. In all cases where results are
known (including small values of N), we ﬁnd that the O(N) vector models saturate our
bounds, and moreover sit near special locations in the space allowed by crossing symmetry.
Inputting the previously measured values of ∆φ, this allows us to give sharp predictions for
∆S, ∆T, and c for diﬀerent values of N.
In order to eﬃciently implement the bootstrap in the presence of a global symmetry,
we will use techniques based on semideﬁnite programming, developed for 4D CFTs in [11].
Here we will show how to adapt this technique for CFTs in an arbitrary number of space-
time dimensions.
This requires approximating conformal blocks as rational functions of
the exchanged operator dimension ∆, and we will show that such a rational approximation
follows directly from a recursion relation expressing a general conformal block as a sum
over poles ∼1/(∆−∆∗) occurring at special (non-unitary) values of the dimension ∆∗
3


--- Page 4 ---

where the conformal multiplet contains a null state. This conformal block representation
generalizes an idea of Zamolodchikov, ﬁrst applied to Virasoro blocks in 2D [33, 34], to
arbitrary space-time dimensions.
This paper is organized as follows.
In section 2 we review the formulation of the
conformal bootstrap for CFTs containing an O(N) global symmetry, as well as convex
optimization techniques for placing bounds on operator dimensions and OPE coeﬃcients.
In section 3 we show how to ﬁnd rational representations for conformal blocks in arbitrary
space-time dimensions, presenting a new recursion relation for conformal blocks as a sum
over poles in ∆. In section 4 we present our bounds and a comparison with the O(N) vector
models. We conclude in section 5.

Conformal Bootstrap with O(N) Global Symmetry
2.1
Statement of Crossing Symmetry
Let us brieﬂy review the formulation of the conformal bootstrap for 3D CFTs with an O(N)
global symmetry. Further details can be found in [9–11]. We focus on theories containing
a scalar primary operator φi of dimension ∆φ, transforming as a fundamental under O(N).
The operator product of φi with itself takes the schematic form
φi × φj ∼

S+

X
T +
O(ij) +

A−
O[ij],
(2.1)
where S+ denotes O(N) singlets of even spin, T + denotes O(N) symmetric tensors of even
spin, and A−denotes O(N) anti-symmetric tensors of odd spin.
By pairing up φ’s and performing the OPE, a four-point function can be decomposed
into conformal blocks as

(2.2)
where each sum runs over primary operators O of dimension ∆and spin ℓappearing in
φi × φj. Here, xij ≡xi −xj, λO is the OPE coeﬃcient of O, and the conformal blocks
g∆,ℓ(u, v) are functions of conformal cross-ratios

The four-point function itself should be independent of how we perform the OPE.
Swapping (1, i) ↔(3, k), we ﬁnd two diﬀerent conformal block expansions of a single four-
point function which must agree with each other. Writing out this condition and isolating

be grouped into a vector “sum rule”

The coeﬃcients λ2
O appearing in (2.4) are unknown a-priori, with the exception of the unit
operator which has λO = 1 if φi is canonically normalized. However, we do know that
the OPE coeﬃcients λO must be real in unitary theories, which means that λ2
O is positive.
Further, in D-dimensional unitary theories the operator dimensions must satisfy the lower
bounds [35–39]

2.2
Bounds from Convex Optimization
From here, we follow the general strategy of [4] for putting bounds on CFT data. Let us
begin by isolating the unit operator in (2.4),
0
=
Vunit +
X
λ2
OVO.
(2.8)
The procedure is as follows:
1. Make an assumption about the CFT spectrum, for instance that all singlet scalars
have dimension above some ∆∗.
2. Try to ﬁnd a linear functional α such that
α(Vunit)
>
0,
α(VO)
≥
0 for all O satisfying the assumption in (1).
(2.9)
3. If such a functional exists, the assumption (1) is ruled out, since applying α to Eq. (2.8)
gives a contradiction. If not, we cannot conclude anything about our assumption.
Step 2 requires us to solve a convex optimization problem: we must search over the
vector space F of linear functionals, subject to linear constraints of the form α(V ) ≥0.
5


--- Page 6 ---

Each linear constraint restricts us to a half-space of F, and together these half-spaces carve
out a convex subset C ⊂F. We would like to determine whether this subset is non-empty.
In the case at hand, we will take our functional α to be linear combinations of derivatives
with respect to the cross-ratios z, z around the crossing symmetric point z = z = 1/2,

(2.10)
The parameter k controls the dimension of the space of linear functionals that we search
over. Note that truncating this search space leads to valid, though possibly suboptimal,
bounds. As we increase k, our bounds get better and better, converging to an optimal
bound as k →∞.
2.3
Formulation as a Semideﬁnite Program
A key diﬃculty in our convex optimization problem is that we have an inﬁnite number
of constraints on α — one for each O which could appear in the OPE. We must impose
α(FR,∆,ℓ) ≥0 for all representations R, dimensions ∆, and spins ℓobeying our assumptions
about the spectrum. An eﬃcient way to deal with this inﬁnity is to reformulate our problem
as a semideﬁnite program, which can include constraints of the form:
α(Pi(x)) for all x ≥0, where Pi(x) are polynomials in x.
(2.11)
Systems of these inequalities can be solved eﬃciently using interior point methods.
To write our constraints α(V ) ≥0 in this form, it suﬃces to ﬁnd an approximation
∂m
z ∂n
z g∆,ℓ(z, z)|z=z=1/2

χℓ(∆)P (m,n)

(∆),
(2.12)
where χℓ(∆) are positive functions, and P (m,n)
ℓ
(∆) are polynomials. (Crucially, χℓ(∆) is
independent of m, n.) Indeed, assuming Eq. (2.12), and combining Eqs. (2.5) and (2.10),
we see that
α(VR,∆,ℓ) ≥0
if and only if
X
m,n,i
ai
m,nP (m,n)
R,ℓ,i (∆) ≥0,
(2.13)
for polynomials P (m,n)
R,ℓ,i (∆). The dimensions ∆satisfy bounds ∆≥∆min,ℓ, so writing ∆=
∆min,ℓ+ x yields a set of inequalities in the form (2.11).
In [11], special analytic expressions for conformal blocks in even dimensions [40, 41]
were used to derive approximations of the form (2.12), which proved suﬃcient for apply-
ing semideﬁnite programming to even dimensional CFTs. These approximations worked
surprisingly well, but it was unclear how to generalize the techniques to CFTs in odd (or
fractional) space-time dimension.
In the next section, we will show that the existence of approximations (2.12) in any
space-time dimension follows naturally from representation theory of the conformal group.

This is suﬃcient for formulating our optimization problem as a semideﬁnite program, which
can then be solved using one of the many freely available semideﬁnite program solvers. We
give details of our implementation using the solver SDPA-GMP in Appendix B.

Rational Representations for Conformal Blocks
3.1
Why Rational Approximations Exist
To compute CFT bounds using semideﬁnite programming, we need precise, systematic
approximations for conformal blocks g∆,ℓin terms of positive functions times polynomials in
∆, or equivalently positive functions times rational functions of ∆with positive denominator.
The existence of such approximations follows from conformal representation theory. Recall
that the conformal block g∆,ℓis a sum over states in radial quantization
g∆,ℓ(u, v)

2∆φ

⟨α|α⟩
,
(3.1)
where O is a conformal primary of dimension ∆and spin ℓ, and α runs over O and all of
its descendants. It will be convenient for our discussion to use the radial coordinates of
[42], where the points xi are arranged as in Fig. 1, and the coordinate ρ is given in terms of
cross-ratios by
ρ =
z
(1 + √1 −z)2,
ρ =
z
(1 + √1 −z)2.
(3.2)
The states P µ1 · · · P µn|O⟩have eigenvalue ∆+n under dilatation and can be decomposed
into traceless symmetric tensor representations of the rotation group. It follows that the
sum over states (3.1) can be written

where r = |ρ|, η = cos θ = (ρ + ρ)/2|ρ|, ν = D/2 −1, and the Cν
j (η) are Gegenbauer poly-
nomials. The coeﬃcients Bn,j can be computed straightforwardly by solving the conformal
Casimir equation
Dg∆,ℓ= C∆,ℓg∆,ℓ,
C∆,ℓ= ∆(∆−D) + ℓ(ℓ+ D −2),
(3.4)
term by term around r = 0. Here, D is a second-order diﬀerential operator in the cross-
ratios u, v, representing the action of the quadratic Casimir of the conformal group on a
four-point function,
Dg(u, v)
=
1
2(L(1)
AB + L(2)
AB)(L(1)AB + L(2)AB)g(u, v).
(3.5)
Further details can be found in [42].
Solving the Casimir equation to second order in r, we ﬁnd [42]
B2,ℓ−2 =
ℓ(ℓ−1)(∆−ℓ−2ν)
2(ℓ+ ν −1)(ℓ+ ν)(∆−ℓ−2ν + 1),
B2,ℓ= ν ∆ν(ν −1) + (∆−1)ℓ(ℓ+ 2ν)
(∆−ν)(ℓ+ ν + 1)(ℓ+ ν −1),
B2ℓ+2 =
(∆+ ℓ)(ℓ+ 2ν)(ℓ+ 2ν + 1)
2(∆+ ℓ+ 1)(ℓ+ ν)(ℓ+ ν + 1).
(3.6)
Let us make some comments about these coeﬃcients. First, Bn,j is a rational function
of ∆.
This is a simple consequence of the Casimir equation (3.4), but it follows more
directly from the expression for g∆,ℓas a sum over states. Each term in the numerator and
denominator of (3.1) can be computed from the action of the conformal algebra on |O⟩.
This action is polynomial in ∆, so Bn,j is rational in ∆.
Secondly, the denominators of Bn,j are positive, as long as ∆obeys the unitarity
bound (2.7). This is because poles in Bn,j occur when a state |α⟩becomes null. However,
the absence of null or negative-norm states in a conformal multiplet is precisely what deﬁnes
the unitarity bound.
These facts are exactly what we need. We can obtain good approximations to conformal
blocks by truncating the expansion (3.3) at some high order r∆+N. Each term in the resulting
expression will be a rational function of ∆, times an overall factor of r∆. The error is na¨ıvely
of order rN, which is quite small at the crossing-symmetric point r = 3−2
√
2 ≈0.17. Indeed,
this na¨ıve estimate is correct, since it can be shown that the coeﬃcients Bn,j are uniformly
bounded as a function of ∆for all n, j.
The cost of keeping more terms in the series expansion (3.3) is that the degree of the
resulting rational approximation grows. As we’ll see in the next subsection, this growth is
slow and under control. Further, additional tricks can improve the rational approximation
signiﬁcantly without increasing the degree. We discuss these in Appendix A.
3.2
Poles in ∆and Recursion Relations for g∆,ℓ
We can be more precise about the structure of our rational approximations by exploiting
an idea of Zamolodchikov, originally applied to Virasoro blocks in 2 dimensions [33, 34].
8


--- Page 9 ---

Recall that poles in g∆,ℓas a function of ∆occur precisely at special values ∆= ∆∗
where some state |α⟩= P n|O⟩in the conformal multiplet of |O⟩becomes null.
When
this happens, all the descendants of |α⟩become null as well, and together they form a
nontrivial sub-representation of the (now reducible) multiplet of |O⟩. Since the pole in ∆
gets contributions from all states in this sub-representation, its residue is proportional to a
conformal block for a primary with the same dimension and spin as |α⟩:
g∆,ℓ

cα

g∆α,ℓα
as
∆→∆∗,
(3.7)
where ∆α = ∆∗+ n, and cα is a coeﬃcient which is independent of conformal cross-ratios.
Poles in ∆determine g∆,ℓup to a function which is analytic on the entire complex plane.
Thus, we can write
g∆,ℓ(r, η)

g(∞)

(3.8)
where g(∞)
ℓ
(∆, r, η) is an entire function of ∆. The block g∆,ℓhas an essential singularity of
the form r∆as ∆→∞. Stripping this oﬀ, we have
h∆,ℓ(r, η)
≡
r−∆g∆,ℓ(r, η),

(3.10)
Note that the entire function h(∞)
ℓ
(r, η) = lim∆→∞h∆,ℓ(r, η) is now independent of ∆, since
it has no singularities as ∆→∞.
With the recursion relation (3.10), we can be more explicit about the form of our positive-
times-polynomial approximation (2.12). Truncating (3.10) to a ﬁnite number of poles ∆i,
it’s clear that
∂m

where

and r = 3 −2

Let us now determine the data entering (3.10). The function h(∞)

In principle, the pole positions ∆i and coeﬃcients ci are determined by the conformal
algebra. It would be interesting to compute them directly. In practice, by inspecting the
solution to the conformal Casimir equation, we ﬁnd that there are three series of poles,
described in Table 1, whose coeﬃcients are as follows:

(3.13)
The recursion relation Eq. (3.10), with poles listed in Table 1, reveals another fact that
proves useful for our implementation: when we truncate the series expansion for h∆,ℓat
order rN, the degree of the resulting rational approximation grows like N.
Not only is
each coeﬃcient Bn,j a rational function, but the number of new factors which enter the
denominator as we increase N →N + 2 is either 2 or 3 (depending on whether N ≤ℓ).
In practice, this means that we can compute the expansion (3.3) to extremely high order
without incurring too much of a performance hit from dealing with large degree polynomials.
Once we know the residues ci(k), our recursion relation (3.10) provides an extremely
eﬃcient way to compute conformal blocks, either analytically in a series expansion, or
numerically (for any number of derivatives around any point (r, η)).
It would be very
interesting to generalize these ideas to other four-point functions — for example, external
scalars φi with diﬀerent dimensions ∆i, or external operators with spin. Although much
progress has been made computing conformal blocks for these types of operators using series
manipulations [40, 41, 43, 13, 42], derivative relations [44, 45], and conformal integrals [46],
we believe the residues ci are the most convenient and directly useful data for numerical
bootstrap applications.

Results and Comparison to O(N) Vector Models
In this section we will present our results from the bootstrap.
We focus our attention
on computing bounds on the lowest singlet dimension ∆S, the lowest symmetric tensor
dimension ∆T, and the central charge c, as a function of the external scalar dimension ∆φ.
Let us begin by summarizing what is known about these quantities in the O(N) vector

than scaling dimensions. Concretely, ∆φ is related to the critical exponent η via ∆φ =
1/2 + η/2. The dimension of the O(N) singlet operator S is related to the critical exponent
ν via ∆S = 3 −1/ν. Finally, the dimension of the O(N) symmetric tensor operator T is
related to the crossover exponents φc and ηc, through the relations ∆T = 3 −φc/ν = 1 + ηc.
In Table 2 we show the most accurate determinations of these dimensions that we have
found in the literature for N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (with N = 1 being the 3D Ising model).
These quantities have also been computed in the large N limit. ∆φ is known to order
1/N3 while ∆S has only been computed to order 1/N2 (see [21] and references therein). The
crossover exponent connected to ∆T was also computed to order 1/N2 in [54]. The results

Bounds on O(N) Singlets
Now we determine a general bound on the O(N) singlet operator dimension ∆S following the
procedure described in section 2.2. We assume there is a gap in the CFT spectrum so that all

Figure 2: Upper bounds on the dimension of the lowest dimension singlet S in the φ × φ
OPE, where φ transforms as a vector under an O(N) global symmetry group.
Here, we
show N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20. The blue error bars represent the best available analytical and
Monte Carlo determinations of the operator dimensions (∆φ, ∆S) in the O(N) vector models
for N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (with N = 1 being the 3D Ising Model). The black crosses show the
predictions in Eq. (4.1) from the large-N expansion for N = 10, 20, ..., 100. In this expansion,
∆φ has been determined to three-loop order, while ∆S is at two-loop order. The dashed line
interpolates the large-N prediction for N ∈(4, ∞).
singlet scalar operators have dimension greater than ∆S, all symmetric tensor scalars have
dimension greater than 1, and the dimensions of all the other operators are constrained
only by the unitarity conditions. Note that due to the assumption on symmetric tensor
scalars this is not the most general bound. However, we found that this mild assumption
improves numerical stability while not signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the bound on ∆S – moreover
the assumption is certainly satisﬁed for O(N) vector models, as can be seen from previous
determinations of the operator dimensions (see Table 2).
The boundaries for the allowed values of ∆S as a function of ∆φ are shown in Fig. 2.
These bounds are determined by a bisection search in ∆S to within 10−3. The parameter
k of section 2.3, controlling the number of derivatives in the functional α, is set to k = 10
everywhere. For a given N, only the values of ∆S below the corresponding solid line are
allowed.
In Fig. 2 we see that the bounds on ∆S grow monotonically from ∆S = 1 at ∆φ = 0.5, the
point corresponding to the non-interacting theory. At a certain value of ∆φ, each boundary
line exhibits a change in the slope. This type of behavior was already discussed for the Ising
12


--- Page 13 ---

model bound in Ref. [13], where it was found that the change in slope occurs at the values
of ∆φ and ∆S corresponding to Ising model point. The changes in slopes are somewhat less
sharp for the O(N) theories; however, they occur in the vicinity of the O(N) vector model
points, shown as points with error bars in Fig. 2. These points always seem to lie very close
to the boundary; in fact it is possible to rigorously reduce the previous error bars using the
bound we obtained.
For large values of N, we can also compare the bound with the results for ∆φ and ∆S
obtained using the 1/N expansion, Eq. 4.1. The 1/N expansion results (shown as black
crosses in Fig. 2) are consistent with our bound at large N. Moreover, the change in the
slope of the boundary line is sharper for large N and it occurs very close to the O(N) vector
model points.
4.2
Bounds on O(N) Symmetric Tensors
Bounds on the dimension of the ﬁrst symmetric tensor scalar operator ∆T are obtained
following a similar procedure as for the singlet bounds. We assume that all the symmetric
tensor scalars have dimension greater than ∆T , all singlet scalars have dimension greater
than 1, and all other operator dimensions satisfy unitarity conditions. The allowed values
of ∆T as a function of ∆φ are shown in Fig. 3 — only the values of ∆T below the solid line
are allowed. Just like in the case of the singlet operators, the boundary lines start at the
free ﬁeld point, ∆φ = 0.5, ∆T = 1 and grow monotonically. The change of the slope is more
gradual than for the singlet bound. The O(N) vector model points from Table 2 appear to
be consistent with the bound to within error bars for N = 2, 3, 4, with some mild tension
between the N = 5 bound and the quoted results from [53] and [50].
At large N the symmetric tensor dimension ∆T approaches 1 in the O(N) model. This
is reﬂected in the fact that our bounds become more and more constraining as N →∞.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that the order 1/N2 computation of ∆T in Eq. 4.1 becomes very close
to our bound (and occurs near changes of slope) at large but ﬁnite values of N, shown in
black crosses at N = 10, 20, ... in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Upper bounds on the dimension of the lowest dimension symmetric tensor T in
the φ × φ OPE, where φ transforms as a vector under an O(N) global symmetry group, for
N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20. We additionally assume that the lowest dimension singlet S has ∆S ≥
1. The blue error bars represent the best available analytical and Monte Carlo determinations
of the operator dimensions (∆φ, ∆T ) in the O(N) vector models for N = 2, 3, 4, 5.
Note
in particular that previous predictions for the O(5) model are essentially ruled out by our
bounds. The black crosses show the predictions in Eq. (4.1) from the large-N expansion for
N = 10, 20, ..., 100. The dashed line interpolates the large-N prediction for N ∈(4, ∞).
where cfree = D/(D −1) is the central charge of a free scalar ﬁeld.
We can ﬁnd an
upper bound on this OPE coeﬃcient as follows. Rewrite the sum rule (2.8), separating
the contribution of the stress tensor:
λ2
S,3,2VS,3,2 = −Vunit −
X
O̸=Tµν
λ2
OVO.
(4.5)
Applying a functional α such that α(VO) ≥0 for all operators in the spectrum other than
unit operator and normalized so that α(VS,3,2) = 1, Eq. (4.5) then yields the inequality
λ2
S,3,2 ≤−α(Vunit).
(4.6)
Finding the functional α that minimizes −α(Vunit) then gives the strongest upper bound on
the OPE coeﬃcient. By Eq. (4.4) this implies a lower bound on the central charge.
The most general bound would be obtained by making no assumptions about the op-
erator spectrum, except that they obey unitarity conditions.
However, we can obtain
a somewhat stronger bound by making additional assumptions about the spectrum.

Figure 4: Lower bounds on the central charge for theories containing a scalar φ transforming

particular, we can assume there are gaps in the spectrum of singlet and symmetric tensor
operators, as long as they are consistent with the results of previous subsections. Here we
will assume mild gaps, ∆S ≥1 and ∆T ≥1. This assumption on the operator dimension
spectrum is not too stringent; for example, we know from previous determinations that
O(N) vector models satisfy these conditions, see Table 2.
The central charge bound as a function of the scalar dimension ∆φ is shown in Fig. 4.
The central charge approximately scales linearly with N (exactly in the non-interacting
theory), so we have plotted c scaled to Ncfree.
At low values of ∆φ, all of the bounds
approach the same asymptote. The slope of the asymptote is −10/3, which is the same
curve that one obtains in the N →∞limit from Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2); i.e. the O(N) vector
model points will lie on that line for large values of N.
To obtain stronger bounds on the central charge we can introduce larger gaps in the
operator spectrum. In the plots of Fig. 5 we assumed that the gap in the singlet scalar
spectrum saturates the bound obtained in subsection 4.1, while the gap in the symmetric
tensor scalar spectrum is kept at ∆T ≥1. At low values of ∆φ, the bounds again approach
the same asymptote and in general don’t diﬀer too much from the bounds in the Fig. 4.
However, here the bounds exhibit a change in the slope at certain value of ∆φ. At larger
values of ∆φ the bounds are much stronger than the ones in Fig. 4. For large N values the
change in the slope occurs at the O(N) vector model points. At smaller N the change in the

Figure 5: Lower bounds on the central charge for theories containing a scalar φ transforming

operators saturate the bounds we found in subsection 4.1, while the symmetric tensor scalar
operators are assumed to have dimensions ∆T ≥1. The black crosses show the predictions

slope is more gradual, but still occurs at ∆φ close to the known values in the O(N) models.
Just like the operator dimensions in the previous subsections, the central charge values
obtained using 1/N expansion in the case of large N lie very close to the boundary line.
Encouraged by these facts, we can conjecture that the central charge values will lie on the
boundary even for low values of N. Using the values of ∆φ determined by other methods, we
can then make a prediction for the values of c. These are shown, along with our bootstrap
predictions for ∆S and ∆T, in Table 3. In calculating these values of c we used the bounds
of Fig. 5, since these are our strongest bounds for the O(N) vector models.

Discussion
Let us take a moment to reﬂect on the results of the previous section.
First, we have
discovered the remarkable fact that operator dimensions in the critical O(N) vector models
take on values which saturate general constraints from crossing symmetry and unitarity.
This gives us an organizing principle by which we can understand why these theories
are special – gaps in the spectrum of operator dimensions are maximized in a way that

Table 3: The values of the scalar and symmetric tensor operator dimensions and the values
of the central charge saturating the obtained bound for the O(N) vector model values of ∆φ.
For N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the value of ∆φ is taken from Table 2; for N = 10, 20 the value of ∆φ
is the 3-loop large-N result. The errors reﬂect the uncertainty in the value of ∆φ. In the
determinations of ∆S,T we have also included a contribution to the error due to our bisection
precision of 0.001. This uncertainty is only in one direction, since the upper bound is rigorous.
is consistent with unitarity. It will be interesting to verify that this trend continues for
operators of higher dimension. A promising approach to extracting more of the spectrum in
these theories is to consider the locations of the zeros of α(VO) along the boundary [7, 15, 17].
We hope to develop this approach in the O(N) models in future work.
As far as we are aware, we have presented the ﬁrst predictions for the central charge in the
O(N) models at small values of N. In doing so we have veriﬁed that there is approximately
linear growth with N and that c < Ncfree for each value of N. It will be interesting if these
predictions can be veriﬁed in lattice simulations of the O(N) models – this will require a
robust lattice construction of the stress-energy tensor, which is a worthwhile task in its own
right. One can also easily extend these methods to determine the ﬂavor central charges,
appearing in ⟨JµJν⟩∝τ, where Jµ is the O(N) current.
In this work we only considered the constraints from crossing symmetry of ⟨φiφjφkφl⟩. It
is very interesting to extend this analysis to include constraints from other correlators, such
as ⟨φiφjφ2φ2⟩, ⟨φ2φ2φ2φ2⟩, ⟨φiφjJµJν⟩, or ⟨φiφjT µνT ρσ⟩. Such extensions are e.g. necessary
in order to learn about the Z2 odd operators in the spectrum of these theories. Studying
these correlators may also help to give a sharper criterion that can be used to determine
the value of ∆φ in the O(N) models, going beyond the fact that it appears to take a value
near (somewhat smooth) changes in slope of the general bounds.
The recursion representation for the conformal blocks presented in section 3 is a powerful
and eﬃcient method of computing conformal blocks in any number of dimensions. This
representation can for example be utilized in studies of CFTs that interpolate between
2 < D < 4, in D = 5, 7 where conformal blocks are similarly complicated, or perhaps in
17


--- Page 18 ---

constructing an argument (extending [55]) that nontrivial CFTs in large D do not exist.
The representation as a sum over poles in ∆may also be useful for making general analytic
arguments (going beyond the large spin arguments of [56, 57]) in the context of the conformal
bootstrap. The sum over poles may also be particularly interesting from the perspective of
Mellin amplitudes [58–66].
Finally, we’d like to emphasize that the O(N) models at N = 2, 3 have numerous
beautiful realizations in experimental condensed matter systems.
E.g., the O(2) model
describes the superﬂuid transition in 4He and the bicritical point in uniaxial magnets
such as GdAlO3, while the O(3) model describes the Curie transition in simple isotropic
magnets such as Ni, Fe, and EuO. Many more examples can be found in [20]. Thus, the
conformal bootstrap in 3D allows one to realize the physicists’ dream – it makes quantitative
predictions in strongly-interacting systems that can be experimentally tested!

Improving Rational Approximations
When truncated to a ﬁnite number of poles ∆i, the recursion relation
h∆,ℓ(r, η)
=
h(∞)
ℓ
(r, η) +
X
i
cirni
∆−∆i
h∆i+ni,ℓi(r, η)
(A.1)
gives a rational approximation for h∆,ℓ= r−∆g∆,ℓas a function of ∆. The precision of
this approximation increases as we include more and more poles ∆i. However, the degree
increases as well, and this can be problematic for computation. Larger degree polynomials
slow down semideﬁnite program solvers.
A useful compromise is to keep n poles ∆1, . . . , ∆n with the largest residues, and use
these as a basis to approximate other poles ∆j with smaller residues. That is, for poles with
small residues, we write
1
∆−∆j
≈
n
X
i=1
ai
∆−∆i
.
(A.2)
where the coeﬃcients ai are chosen to make the approximation as good as possible. In
this way, we can approximately include the contribution of the pole at ∆= ∆j without
increasing the degree of our rational function. Note that the ∆i lie below the unitarity
bound ∆unitarity, so ∆itself never approaches a pole when we compute CFT bounds.
How should we choose the coeﬃcients ai? We need Eq. (A.2) to hold to high accuracy
across all ∆≥∆unitarity (away from the singularities on both sides). A method that works
well in practice is to ensure that Eq. (A.2) and its ﬁrst n/2 derivatives hold exactly at
∆= ∆unitarity and at ∆= ∞. These conditions give n linear equations which determine the
ai.
In practice, including poles with residues less than 10−2 yields rational approximations
to conformal blocks which are correct to within 10−9. Including poles with residues less
than 10−10 yields approximations correct to within 10−22.

Implementation in Mathematica and SDPA-GMP
A brief summary of our implementation is as follows. All steps but the last are performed
in Mathematica.

crossing symmetric point ∂m

η g∆,ℓ≈r∆P (m,n)
ℓ
(∆)/Qℓ(∆), where r = 3 −2
√
2. This
can be done using either the Gegenbauer expansion and Casimir equation described
in [42], or more eﬃciently using our recursion relation (3.10). The recursion relation
can be implemented numerically in the space of vectors of (r, η) derivatives, where
multiplication by rk is a matrix on this space. We compute approximations up to
order 60 in the r-expansion.

2. We approximate “small” poles as described in Appendix A, resulting in a new rational
approximation with smaller degree ∂m
r ∂n
η g∆,ℓ≈r∆p(m,n)

poles to keep and which poles to approximate, we choose a threshold value θ and

r ∂nη g∆,ℓ|∆=unitarity bound
 .
(B.1)
Poles with θi ≤θ are approximated in terms of other poles. In practice, we found
that θ = 10−2 gives a good tradeoﬀbetween accuracy and speed. We have checked
that our results remain essentially unchanged as θ is varied between 10−2 and 10−12.
After reducing the degree of our rational approximation, the factors r∆/qℓ(∆) can be
discarded. Henceforth, we will use “∼” to indicate approximate equality up to an
overall positive function of ∆.
3. To compute a bound, we need derivatives ∂m
z ∂n
z VR,∆,ℓ, where the vectors VR,∆,ℓare
deﬁned in (2.5). These are linearly related to the vectors of derivatives of g∆,ℓ,

where i = 1, 2, 3 runs over the components of VR,∆,ℓand MR,∆φ is a matrix depending
only on the representation/channel R and the external operator dimension ∆φ.
4. In section 2.3, we deﬁned a semideﬁnite program as an aﬃne optimization problem
which can include constraints of the form
α(Pi(x)) for all x ≥0, where Pi(x) are polynomials in x.
(B.3)
More precisely, semideﬁnite programs can include matrix inequalities of the form
X is positive semideﬁnite,
(B.4)
where X is a matrix of variables (which might be subject to additional linear con-
straints).
The transformation of a set of inequalities from the form (B.3) to the
form (B.4) is standard in the optimization literature [67] and is described in detail in
[11]. We transform our polynomial inequalities
ai
mn(MR,∆φ)mn
i
rsP (r,s)
ℓ
(∆min,ℓ+ x) ≥0
for x ≥0
(B.5)
into matrix inequalities in this fashion.
5. Once written in terms of matrix inequalities, our semideﬁnite program can be solved
using a variety of freely available tools. For this work, we use the solver SDPA-GMP
with the parameters listed in Table 4. Our plots are computed in parallel by assigning
each point to an individual cluster node. Our cluster management software is written
in Cloud Haskell.
