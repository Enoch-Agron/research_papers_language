3. Other Image Defects Caused by Reconstruction
Notice in Figure 2, that a reconstruction filter K(v) has two tasks. First
it must remove the extraneous replicas of the signal spectrum (to prevent
aliasing). Second, it should pass the original signal base band, but the
signal can be distorted if this is not done perfectly. This second type of
reconstruction error will be referred to as base-band attenuation.
From the previous section, one might assume that the literature of signal

sense that its value and first derivative are continuous everywhere.
Discontinuities in k(x) will lead to high-frequency leakage in the fre-
